DOM Review is a Chrome extension that bridges the gap between what you see in the browser and what your AI coding agent needs to fix. 

Built for the vibecoding workflow: you look at your app, point at what's off, describe the fix in plain English, and your AI agent reads your reviews straight from Chrome and makes the changes.

How it works:
1. Click any element on your page
2. Write a comment (e.g., "make this bolder")
3. Your AI Agent reads the reviews from the live page via Chrome DevTools MCP and edits the code!

DOM Review captures all the necessary context for your AI Agent:
- CSS selectors (smart generation that avoids utility classes like Tailwind/Bootstrap)
- Computed styles (colors, fonts, display, dimensions)
- Accessibility attributes (ARIA roles, labels, tab index)
- Framework component info (detects React, Vue, Angular components and props)

DOM Review comes with a Sidebar Panel where you can manage all your reviews, filter them by status, and sort by date, priority, or category. You can also export/import reviews as JSON files if you're not using MCP yet.

Say goodbye to copy-pasting selectors and losing context. Let your AI agent read the DOM directly!
